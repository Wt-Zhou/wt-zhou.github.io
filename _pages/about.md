<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the School of Vehicle and Mobility, Tsinghua University, where I am dedicated to developing trustworthy AI systems for real-world autonomous driving. My research focuses on data-driven planners(including end-to-end approaches), reinforcement learning, and continual learning.

I earned my Ph.D. from the School of Vehicle and Mobility, Tsinghua University, advised by Professor Yang Diange. My doctoral research introduced an online continual learning planner for autonomous vehicles, addressing the challenge of ensuring system performance in long-tail cases. This technology was successfully demonstrated during the autonomous driving operations at the Shougang Park venue for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.

Currently, I am collaborating with leading companies such as DiDi Autonomous Driving, Toyota, and Dongfeng to apply my research outcomes to mass-produced autonomous driving systems. In 2024, I led my team to win the Mcity AV Challenge in the United States. My contributions have also been recognized with the Outstanding Doctoral Paper Presentation Award at the China Society of Automotive Engineers Doctoral Forum and the prestigious Tsinghua University "Shuimu Scholar" Postdoctoral Fellowship.

[Dynamically conservative self-driving planner for long-tail cases](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.07497)

**Weitao Zhou**, Zhong Cao, Nanshan Deng, Xiaoyu Liu, Kun Jiang, Diange Yang


- This work proposes a method to automatically adjust the conservative level of self-driving vehicles according to each case‚Äôs ‚Äúlong-tail‚Äù rate, which provides a technique to guarantee 
 performance in unexpected driving cases without resorting to a global conservative setting.

-  The proposed planner can estimate and constrain performance uncertainty by itself, which quantifies potential performance drop due to insufficient training data or
network fitting errors.

[Continuous improvement of self-driving cars using dynamic confidence-aware reinforcement learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-023-00610-y)

 Zhong Cao, Kun Jiang, **Weitao Zhou**, Shaobing Xu, Huei Peng, Diange Yang

[**Project**](https://github.com/zhcao92/DCARL) 
- We present a dynamic confidence-aware reinforcement learning (DCARL) technology for guaranteed continuous improvement. Continuously improving means that more training always improves or maintains its current performance. Our technique enables performance improvement using the data collected during driving, and does not need a lengthy pre-training phase.
